# CommunityAndroidApp
This app will facilitate communities in identifying and solving concerns in their area, or organizing public community events. Users can bring attention to a concern or event by placing a pin on a map, and other users can interact with the pin to assist, attend, or learn more.

In order to run it, add the various files to the appropriate folders in a new android studio project, and generate a new google maps key and a google API config file.
